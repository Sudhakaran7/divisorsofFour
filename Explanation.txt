Given an integer array nums, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors.
If there is no such integer in the array, return 0.

Input Description:
First line contains n, size of array
Second line contains n elements fo array

Output Description:
Print the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors

Sample Input:
3
21 4 7

Sample Output:
32

Explanation:
21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.
